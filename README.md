# Mystic Dream: Customer API


## Overview
The support team at Mystic Dream is streamlining their customer logistics. With a spike in new cutomers, it is more difficult to manage and track all the steps involved in scheduling customer trips. An interface has been built.

The goal of this project is to build two APIs that:
 
* Manage customer information
* Manage and track steps in the planning process

## Code template
This code borrows heavily from a [Spring REST tutorial](http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/bookmarks/) as well as the [Katharsis Spring example](https://github.com/katharsis-project/katharsis-framework/tree/master/katharsis-examples/spring-boot-simple-example).

## Dependencies
The code uses: 

* Spring Boot
* H2
* Maven
* Katharsis

## Running with Maven
```
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
